# 🔒 Security — Odyssi

Odyssi protects the average user's digital autonomy, even in offline environments.

## 🔐 Core Principles
- **Local-First**: Data lives on the device, not in the cloud.
- **Consent-Driven Syncing**: No auto-uploading, ever.
- **Zero Advertising**: No trackers or monetization of user data.
- **Encryption by Default**: AES-256 on all data with passphrase + optional biometric

## 🛡️ Advanced Features
- Optional password rotation
- Emergency wipe mode
- Time-based vault lockouts
- Open-source cryptography (planned)

## 🧪 Known Limitations
- App data is vulnerable if device is fully compromised and user has no password
- Sync features not yet E2E-encrypted (coming in beta)
